# AI-Driven-Occupancy-Detection-Using-Multisensor-Data-Analysis
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to estimate indoor occupancy using data from non-intrusive sensors. By monitoring temperature, light, sound, CO2 levels, and motion, the system accurately detects the number of occupants. It helps optimize energy use in smart buildings by adjusting HVAC and lighting based on real-time occupancy.
